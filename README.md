# Chikungunya Model
Modelo chikungunya caribe:
* This is set of python scripts that aim to model the initial stages of the CHIKV global outbreak in The Americas that started at the end of the year 2013. It was the first tme that the CHIKV was observed to be transmitted locally in the Western Hemisphere and the outbreak poses a clear example of an infection disease invasion into na√Øve territories. 
* The CHIKV outbreak started in the Saint Martin island in The Caribean and soon spreaded over all the neighbouring islands and hit continental land. 
* The model couples a SEIR with a network model that represents the commercial planes routes that connected the islands in the Caribbean during the outbreak. The main assumption of the model is that the CHIKV spread in the islands and territories in ethe Caribbean responded to the topology of connection of the island that let people carry the infection from one island to another
